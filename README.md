## About the project

This project consists on generating an app/web to solve an specific problem, the huge work an administrator of buildings have. The day to day of the administrator is receiving a lot of messages/emails that notify him the incidences a building have. An administrator of buildings in Spain has on average 50 buildings to administrate. Taking into account this number the work of him/her is very vig so we simplified his life. In Fincup, the administrator have a detail of his buildings, incidences that he has to manage and can see the owners of the doors, and the service they have available on the app. In incidences, the administrator can have a follow-up of them and can see the status of the incidence to keep sure is being processed of is pending, etc.

## Summary of the project

In the Frontend of the project we created different pages in order to organize the work of the administrator, he can log in or register, he can have a detailed view of the tasks he must do as well as eht incidences and in both of them is specified in which building have that work. He can see all the buildings he manage and can have more details of an specific building. If he wants, he can click on incidences to see all the incidences that building have, or if he is going to manage a new building he can create it by clicking in the plus icon. The building have a button that allows him/her to see all the details of that building, such as the doors, owners, services, reminders etc. We used redux to manage all the states and allow us to bring specific information bringed from the components.
